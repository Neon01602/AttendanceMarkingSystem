# AttendanceMarkingSystem
An automatic attendance marking system which uses Facial-Recognition in Python and MySQL.

Note: You need to train your own dataset to recognize your face, providing the required location of the file in which the dataset should be stored.

Make sure to clear the SQL table each time you use the "final_#2.py" file.
